# EngineeringProjects

I used this project to get familiar with the functions/options available on SOLIDWORKS. 
The design, dimensions and parameters of parts are not by my calculations and design, rather I used a tutorial on YouTube and followed it.
This has opened my mind to many available functions that SOLIDWORKS offers. 
Furthermore, this project has given me an idea of when my CAD sketches might not work and generally a basic procedure for tackling CAD. 
In my opinion this is a very easy, interesting, and interactive way of understanding what the platform has to offer. 
In this project I have learned how to sketch, extrude, sweep, assemble two surfaces with conditions and many more.
